•	HTTP Request Message
-	A request message from a client to a server includes, within the first line of that message, the method to be applied to the resource, the identifier of the resource, and the protocol version in use.

o	Request Line
	The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence
	Method
	The Method token indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the Request-URI. The method is case-sensitive.

	Request – URI
	The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.

Request-URI    = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority


o	The Request Identified by a Request
1.	If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be ignored.
2.	If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header field value.
3.	If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.

o	Request Header Fields
	The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server.
	These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.
