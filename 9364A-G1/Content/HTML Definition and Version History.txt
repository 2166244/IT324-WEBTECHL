HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language)
•	To publish information for global distribution, one needs a universally understood language, a kind of publishing mother tongue that all computers may potentially understand.
•	The publishing language used by the World Wide Web is HTML (from HyperText Markup Language).
•	The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent.
•	HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains.
•	HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of existing bodies of information.
•	HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information initiative since 1990.
•	This specification roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994.
•	HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

VERSION HISTORY OF HTML

•	STANDARDS
o	HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866, Nov 1995)
-	T. Berners-Lee and D. Connolly, November 1995.
-	The HTML 2.0 specification RFC 1866, is a product of the HTML Working Group of the IETF, edited by Dan Connolly.
-	includes both machine-readable public text – SGML which includes the DTD, an SGML declaration, and a version of the ISO Added Latin 1 entity set.

o	HTML 3.2 (W3C Recommendation, Jan 1997)
-	developed in early `96 together with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corporation, Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass, and Sun Microsystems.
-	adds widely deployed features such as tables, applets and text flow around images, while providing full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0.

o	HTML 4.0 (W3C Recommendation, Dec 1999)
-	supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities.
-	takes great strides towards the internationalization of documents, with the goal of making the Web truly World Wide.
-	is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language [ISO8879]).

o	 HTML 4.0.1 (W3C Recommendation, Apr )
-	Subversion of HTML 4.0
-	is a revision of HTML 4.0 that corrects errors and makes some changes since the previous revision.
-	Separate structure and presentation
-	Consider universal accessibility to the Web
-	Help user agents with incremental rendering

o	XHTML (W3C Recommendation, August 2002)
-	is a family of current and future document types and modules that reproduce, subset, and extend HTML 4 [HTML4].
-	XHTML documents are XML conforming.
-	XHTML documents can utilize applications (e.g. scripts and applets) that rely upon either the HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model [DOM].

o	HTML 5 (W3C Recommendation, October 2014)
-	the fifth major revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the format used to build Web pages and applications, and the cornerstone of the Open Web Platform.
-	brings to the Web video and audio tracks without needing plugins
-	programmatic access to a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which is useful for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly
-	native support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) and math (MathML)
-	annotations important for East Asian typography (Ruby)
-	features to enable accessibility of rich applications

“Today we think nothing of watching video and audio natively in the browser, and nothing of running a browser on a phone,” said Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director. “We expect to be able to share photos, shop, read the news, and look up information anywhere, on any device. Though they remain invisible to most users, HTML5 and the Open Web Platform are driving these growing user expectations.”
