Web Technology is known as the method by which the computers communicate with one another
	through the use of markup languages and multimedia packages. It gives a way for people
	to interact with hosted information like websites. It involves the use of hypertext
	markup language (HTML) and the cascading stylesheet (CSS).

DNS or Domain Name System is the Internet's system used in converting alphabetic names in IP addresses.
	When a web address (URL) is inputted or types into a web browser, the DNS Servers will
	return the IP address of the web server associated with that name.

LOOPBACK ADDRESS is a type of Internet Protocol address or IP address used in testing
	the communication or medium transportation on local network and/or to test
	network applications.

VIRTUAL HOST provides Web services that include server functions and Internet connection services.
	 A virtual host is often used by companies or individuals that do not want to purchase and 
	 maintain their own Web servers and Internet connections.

IP address or Internet Protocol address or simply an IP, is a unique address that identifies
	 a device on the Internet or a local network.

WAIS or Wide Area Information Server is a program that can index enormous amounts of information 
	and make it searchable across large networks (including the Internet).
