HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, May 1996) - GET, POST, HEAD
HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2068, Jan 1997)

HTTP FUNDAMENTALS

 HTTP uses a request-response protocol
 HTTP is a stateless communication protocol and it does not keep 
 information about clients in between requests
 
 HTTP Resource Addressing
 > resources are identified using URIs (RFC 3986)
 
 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax
   A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of
   characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.
   

   
   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides a simple and extensible
   means for identifying a resource. URI syntax
   and semantics is derived from concepts introduced by the World Wide
   Web global information initiative, whose use of these identifiers
   dates from 1990 and is described in "Universal Resource Identifiers
   in WWW" [RFC1630].  The syntax is designed to meet the
   recommendations laid out in "Functional Recommendations for Internet
   Resource Locators" [RFC1736] and "Functional Requirements for Uniform
   Resource Names" [RFC1737].
 
 Overview of the URIs
	Uniform - It allows different types of resource identifiers to be used in the same
	context, even when the mechanisms used to access those resources may differ.
	
	-uniform semantic interpretation of common syntactic conventions across different types
	of resource identifiers
	
	- allows introduction of new types of resource identifiers without interfering with the 
	the way that existing identifiers are used

	- allows the identifiers to be reused in many different contexts, thus permitting the 
	new applications or protocols to leverage a pre-existing, large, and widely used of 
	resource identifiers.
	
	Resource - Source of information with a consistent purpose, service, and other collection 
	of resources
	- not necessarily accessible via the Internet
	- abstract concepts such as operators and operands of a mathematical equation, numeric values
	
	Identifier - embodies the information required to distinguish what is being identified from all 
	other things within its scope of identification
	
URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- refers to the subset of URIs, in identifying a resource, provide a means of locating the resource 
by describing its primary access mechanisms (e.g - its network "location")

URN (Uniform Resource Name)
- it refers to both URIs under the "urn" scheme (RFC 2141), which is required to remain 
globally unique even when the resource ceases to exists or becomes unavailable, and 
to any other URI with the properties of a name.

HTTP URL 
The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 and the Internet Engineering 
Task Force (IETF) URI working group. The URL format is specified in RFC 1738 Uniform Resource 
Locators (URL).

STANDARD HTTP REQUEST METHODS
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. 
Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them: some of which is
a request method can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.

GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
POST
The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server
PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
CONNECT
The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
OPTIONS
The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
TRACE
The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

PATCH
The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

9 Method Definitions
The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below. Although this set can be expanded, 
additional methods cannot be assumed to share the same semantics for separately extended 
clients and servers.

SAFE METHODS
In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT 
have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be 
considered "safe". This allows user agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT 
and DELETE, in a special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly 
unsafe action is being requested.

IDEMPOTENT METHODS
Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) 
the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, 
HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side 
effects, and so are inherently idempotent.

CACHEABLE METHODS
Message that is already in cache


HTTP STATUS CODES 
Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. It includes 
codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in 
some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
