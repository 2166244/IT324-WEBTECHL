URL
	**introduction**
- URL or Universal Resource Identifiers is a compact string representation for a resource available via the Internt.
- The spcification of URL is designed to meet the requirements laid out in "Functional Requirements 
	for Internet Resource Locators".

	**URL General Syntax**
- URLs are used to `locate' resources, by providing an abstract
   identification of the resource location. 
-  a system may perform a variety of operations on the resource, as
   might be characterized by such words as `access', `update',
   `replace', `find attributes'.
- only the `access' method
   needs to be specified for any URL scheme.

	**The main part of URL**
- A URL contains the name of the scheme being used (<scheme>) followed
   by a colon and then a string (the <scheme-specific-part>) whose
   interpretation depends on the scheme.
- Scheme names consist of a sequence of characters.
- The lower case letters "a"--"z", digits, and the characters plus ("+"), period
   ("."), and hyphen ("-") are allowed. 
- For resiliency, programs interpreting URLs should treat upper case letters as equivalent to
   lower case in scheme names (e.g., allow "HTTP" as well as "http").

	**URL Character Encoding Issues**
- URLs are sequences of characters, i.e., letters, digits, and special
   characters.
- A URLs may be represented in a variety of ways: e.g., ink
   on paper, or a sequence of octets in a coded character set.
- The interpretation of a URL depends only on the identity of the
   characters used.
- In most URL schemes, the sequences of characters in different parts
   of a URL are used to represent sequences of octets used in Internet
   protocols. 
- in the ftp scheme, the host name, directory
   name and file names are such sequences of octets, represented by
   parts of the URL.
-  Within the parts mentioned above, an octet may be represented by  
   the chararacter which has that octet as its code within the US-ASCII
   [20] coded character set.)
- octets may be encoded by a character triplet consisting
   of the character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal digits (from
   "0123456789ABCDEF") which forming the hexadecimal value of the octet.
- The characters "abcdef" may also be used in hexadecimal encodings.
- OCTETS MUST BE ENCODED IF:
	- they have no corresponding graphic character within the US-ASCII coded character set
	- the use of the character is unsafe
	- the corresponding character is reserved for some other interpretation within the particular URL scheme.
- URLs are written only with the graphic printable characters of the
   US-ASCII coded character set.
- The octets 80-FF hexadecimal are not
   used in US-ASCII, and the octets 00-1F and 7F hexadecimal represent
   control characters; these must be encoded.

===unsafe===
- The space character is unsafe because significant spaces may disappear and
   insignificant spaces may be introduced when URLs are transcribed or
   typeset or subjected to the treatment of word-processing programs.
- The characters "<" and ">" are unsafe because they are used as the
   delimiters around URLs in free text; the quote mark (""") is used to
   delimit URLs in some systems.
- The character "#" is unsafe and should
   always be encoded because it is used in World Wide Web and in other
   systems to delimit a URL from a fragment/anchor identifier that might
   follow it. 
- The character "%" is unsafe because it is used for
   encodings of other characters.
-  Other characters are unsafe because
   gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify
   such characters. These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", "~",
   "[", "]", and "`".
- All unsafe characters must always be encoded within a URL. 

===reservered===
- Many URL schemes reserve certain characters for a special meaning:
   their appearance in the scheme-specific part of the URL has a
   designated semantics.
- If the character corresponding to an octet is
   reserved in a scheme, the octet must be encoded.  
- The characters ";", "/", "?", ":", "@", "=" and "&" are the characters which may be
   reserved for special meaning within a scheme.
- No other characters may be reserved within a scheme aside from the characters mentioned above.
- Usually a URL has the same interpretation when an octet is
   represented by a character and when it encoded. 
- the 5th bullet is not true for reserved characters: encoding a character reserved for a
   particular scheme may change the semantics of a URL.
- only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*'(),", and
   reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
   unencoded within a URL.
- characters that are not required to be encoded
   (including alphanumerics) may be encoded within the scheme-specific
   part of a URL, as long as they are not being used for a reserved
   purpose.
