•	HTML DOCUMENT STRUCTURE
o	Composed of three parts:
1.	a line containing HTML version information,
2.	a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element),
3.	a body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the FRAMESET element.

o	The HTML element
-	Start tag: optional, End tag: optional
-	After document type declaration, the remainder of an HTML document is contained by the HTML element.

	THE DOCUMENT HEAD
	The HEAD element
	contains information about the current document, such as its title, keywords that may be useful to search engines, and other data that is not considered document content.

	The TITLE element
	The TITLE element is not considered part of the flow of text. It should be displayed, for example as the page header or window title. Exactly one title is required per document.

	The TITLE attribute
	The title attribute has an additional role when used with the LINK element to designate an external style sheet. Please consult the section on links and style sheets for details.

	Meta data
	The META element specifies a property (here "Author") and assigns a value to it (here "Dave Raggett").
	The META element can be used to identify properties of a document (e.g., author, expiration date, a list of key words, etc.) and assign values to those properties.
	Each META element specifies a property/value pair.

	THE DOCUMENT BODY
	The BODY element
	contains the document's content.
	The content may be presented by a user agent in a variety of ways.
	Element identifiers: the id and class attributes
	The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element (which may be verified by an SGML parser).
	The class attribute, on the other hand, assigns one or more class names to an element; the element may be said to belong to these classes. A class name may be shared by several element instances.
